# Jenkins on DC/OS
This is a copy of the mesosphere DCOS Jenkins for my environment.

You probably would rather go here --> https://github.com/mesosphere/jenkins-dcos

But if you are having trouble starting Jenkins from the Universe in DCOS you may want to look at this.

The result of this build is a docker image.
It is here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nelsd/dcos-jenkins/
